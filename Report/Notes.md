# Teacher Learning and Professional Development in Science Education
## What Do We Mean by Professional Development?
### Bell and Gilbert’s Model（作者非常支持这个模型）
Teacher: from a process of transmitting knowledge

教师在转变——teachers reconstructed their understanding of what it means to be a science teacher in fundamental ways.
  
To a process of helping students to construct scientiﬁc knowledge
	1. through questioning and testing existing ideas
	2. engaging in different activities and contexts for learning
	3. reﬂecting on learning.

教师学习也在转变  
Based on a view of learning that takes into account human development and
	1. the development of self-identity
	2. social constructivism
	3. reﬂective and critical enquiry

Bell and Gilbert use the term teacher development interchangeably with teacher learning——在他们看来教师发展和教师学习是可以互换的。

Yet a distinction between the terms ‘development’ and ‘learning’ has since received some attention in the literature.但是许多文章仍然指出了些许不同之处。（比如Garry Hoban——但是我们不管他）

作者的态度：encompasses the notion of ‘learning’

### What Is the Nature of Teacher Learning? 教师学习的本质
We conceptualise teacher learning as a complex combination of the individual teacher’s knowledge growth, the professional teacher practicing in a particular setting and the social teacher working collaboratively with others in that setting.

#### Teacher learning vs Professional development
Teachers’ professional learning can be taken to represent the processes that, whether intuitive or deliberate, individual or social, result in speciﬁc changes in professional knowledge, skills, attitudes, beliefs or actions of teachers. 有意无意的变化

Teachers’ professional development, on the other hand, is taken to refer to the broader changes that may take place over a longer period of time resulting in qualitative shifts in aspects of teachers’ professionalism. 专业发展范围广泛引起质变：Addressing broader issues of designing programmes, and to speciﬁc strategies for professional learning of teachers.
#### Professional change / growth
Transactions between  
teachers’ knowledge, experience and beliefs (individual aspects) vs their professional actions (pro aspects)

个人认知 cognitive perspective: construction of knowledge in the personal domain of the individual teacher, e.g. PCK
社会情景 situated perspective: evolving practices of the teacher

### What Factors Help Teacher Learning?

**Each condition is unlikely to sustain teacher learning; it is the combination of conditions that is important.**

AKA: how the domains of Bell and Gilbert’s model can progress, or how Clarke and Hollingsworth’s ‘growth’ can be facilitated.

OPENS: We found that teachers were so different in their individual needs and contexts that these features of existing practice, negotiation, reﬂection and evaluation were critical for change (Jones et al. 1992). 

CASE: Two parts: textbooks for students and PD for teachers. 

CASE的启示：Factors inﬂuencing individual teacher learning became apparent through close contact with teachers, and included motivation to want to change, an understanding of the theoretical basis of the curriculum materials and teaching approach, and an appreciation of perceived beneﬁts for students.

### What Models of Teacher Learning Can Be Used?
#### Bell and Gilbert’s: Personal Professional Social
1. Teachers begin to see an aspect of their teaching as problematic (personal) and practicing in isolation as problematic (social), so they are motivated to seek out and try out new ideas in their practice (professional).
2. As they progress in their development, teachers deal with feelings and concerns that come about as they behave differently, for example, loss of control, insecurity in subject knowledge, or uncertainty about how to intervene, and begin to change their ideas of what it means to be a science teacher (personal).
3. Progressing further in their development teachers feel empowered through increasing conﬁdence (personal), they initiate or seek out collaboration (social) and eventually facilitate new kinds of professional development activities (professional).

Reflection - key condition

#### Clarke and Hollingsworth
a cyclic version of Thomas Guskey’s (1986) linear model for change

different entry points: the mediating processes of reﬂection and enactment in distinct domains
1. the personal domain (teacher knowledge, beliefs and attitudes)  
2. the domain of practice (professional experimentation)   
3. the domain of consequence (salient outcomes).  
4. External domain  

Enactment - to distinguish the translation of a belief or a pedagogical model into action from simply ‘acting’.

Organised along a spectrum that identiﬁes the potential for transformative practice.

The ﬁrst set of models includes those that focus on training,
The next set of models includes those based on coaching/mentoring and communities of practice

Learning communities that work through a shared vision or ideology that is realised through shared commitments supported by organisational opportunities for learning.
